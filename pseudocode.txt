loop -> 800:

matrix multiplication with weights -> 1 number

sigmoid out= sigmoid function -> numbers
error = label[i] -  sigmoid out
push error into a vector
exit loop

loop -> 800


one loop for train goes till 800
    get new index using rand
    nested loop until max columnNum
        use index to push existing information into vectors for train
        erase those indexes from temp matrix

one loop for test goes till empty
    get new index using rand
    nested loop until max columnNum
        use index to push existing information into vectors for test
        erase those indexes from temp matrix
