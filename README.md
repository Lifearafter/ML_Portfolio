# Portfolio

This is a portfolio for CS 4375 - Machine Learning.

## Overview of ML

This document contains my understanding of general ML topics and definitions.

You can see the [overview here](pdfs/OverviewOfML.pdf).

## Data Exploration in CPP

This document contains my implementations for R data exploration functions in c++;

You can see the [code here](code/dataexploration.cpp) and the [descriptive document here](pdfs/DataExploration.pdf).

## Linear Models

This document contains my linear models for the earthquake dataset.

You can see the [R Notebook here](code/Regression.Rmd) and the [descriptive document here](pdfs/Regression.pdf).

## C++ Implementation of Algorithms

This document contains my c++ implementation different classification algorithms.

You can see the [Naive Bayes](code/NaiveBayes.c++), [Logarithmic Regression](code/LogarithmicReg.cpp) and the [descriptive document here](pdfs/C++Algorithms.pdf).

## Dimensionality Reduction

This document contains the notebook for the dimensionality reduction part of the Similarity and Ensemble project.

You can see the [RMD Notebook](code/Dimensionality_Reduction.rmd) and the [descriptive document here](pdfs/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf).
